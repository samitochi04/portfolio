# PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENT RULES

## üéØ PROJECT MISSION
Create a stunning, professional 3D portfolio for Samuel FOTSO that will impress recruiters and showcase his skills as a Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer.

## üö® CRITICAL RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE

### 1. CODE PRESERVATION
- **NEVER delete or break existing code**
- **ALWAYS preserve** the current Header.jsx functionality
- **ALWAYS preserve** the existing i18n structure and translations
- **ALWAYS preserve** the current file structure unless explicitly adding new files
- Before modifying any existing file, read it completely to understand its current state

### 2. FILE STRUCTURE INTEGRITY
- **RESPECT the file structure** defined in TODO.md
- **NO files should be deleted** from the current structure
- **ONLY ADD** new files as specified in the TODO.md
- **MAINTAIN** the existing folder hierarchy
- When creating new files, follow the established naming conventions

### 3. TRANSLATION SYSTEM RULES
- **French is the PRIMARY language** (default)
- **Maintain support** for English (en) and German (de)
- **Keep translation.json files clean** and well-structured
- **Use existing translation keys** where possible
- **Add new translations** for all new content in all 3 languages
- **NEVER remove** existing translation keys

### 4. DESIGN & STYLING CONSISTENCY
- **Primary colors**: Black & White (like existing Header)
- **Accent colors**: Choose colors that complement B&W theme and maintain consistency
- **Use Tailwind CSS** for styling (already configured)
- **Maintain responsive design** across all components
- **Follow existing Header styling** patterns for consistency

- **Use context only when necessary** (auth, theme, language)

### API Integration Rules
- **Use Supabase client** for all database operations
- **Implement proper error handling** for all API calls
- **Add loading states** for all async operations

## üì± ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS

### WCAG Compliance
- **Maintain proper color contrast** ratios
- **Provide alt text** for images and 3D elements
- **Ensure keyboard navigation** works everywhere
- **Support screen readers** with proper ARIA labels
- **Respect reduced motion preferences**

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Mobile-first approach** for all components
- **Test on various screen sizes** (320px to 4k)
- **Optimize 3D performance** for mobile devices
- **Provide touch-friendly interactions**

## üéØ FEATURE-SPECIFIC RULES

### 3D Elements
- **Performance is critical** - always test on lower-end devices
- **Provide graceful degradation** for unsupported browsers
