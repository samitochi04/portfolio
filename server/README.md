- Gmail account (for email functionality)
- OpenAI API key (for chatbot)

### 1. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure it:
```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with your credentials:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### 2. Gmail Setup for Email Functionality

1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
2. Go to [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. Generate an App Password for "Mail"
4. Use this App Password as `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in your .env file

### 3. Database Setup

Run the database schema in your Supabase SQL editor:
```bash
npm run setup-db
```

Or manually execute the SQL file: `scripts/supabase-setup.sql`

### 4. Seed Data

Populate the database with sample data:
```bash
# Seed all data (skills, experiences, projects)
npm run seed

# Seed certifications specifically
npm run seed-certif
```

### 5. Start the Server

```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3001`
